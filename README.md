## Predicting Intraday Volume and Its Implication on Algorithmic Trading

### Abstract
Trading volume has many important implications in the financial industry as an indicator of market activities. Accurately forecasting intraday trading volume is also critical to algorithmic trading, as it influences liquidity and market impact. This work develops a novel approach based on the Kalman filter and neural network to predict intraday trading volume efficiently. It also proposes an enhanced version incorporating
robust techniques to handle market noise and outliers, leading to superior performance in volume forecasting and Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) tracking. We also go beyond predicting the volume alone by leveraging this data to build up a simulated execution algorithm and innovatively separate the order flow direction from the Limit Order Book (LOB) and construct a Directional Volume Weighted Price (DVWAP)
method. Our results show that successfully applying these techniques improves the transaction cost and beats the naive price movement assumption.
